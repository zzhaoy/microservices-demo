## Deployment on Amazon EC/2 Container Service

<!-- deploy-doc require-env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_DEFAULT_REGION -->

### Goal

This directory contains the necessary tools to install an instance of the microservice demo application on [AWS ECS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html).

### Installation

To deploy, you will need an [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://aws.amazon.com) account.

#### Using CloudFormation

[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?templateURL=https:%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fweaveworks-cfn-public%2Fmicroservices-demo%2Fmicroservices-demo.json)

By clicking "Launch Stack" button above, you will get redirected to AWS CloudFormation console. You will be asked to set cluster size (***`Scale`***) and instance type (***`EcsInstanceType`***).

### Using CLI

To use CLI, you also need to have the [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html) set up and configured.

Other required packages are:
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_one/)


<!-- deploy-doc-start create-infrastructure -->

    cd deploy/aws-ecs/
    ./msdemo-cli build

<!-- deploy-doc-end -->


This may take a few minutes to complete. Once it's done, it will print the URL for the demo frontend, as well as the URL for the Weave Scope instance that can be used to visualize the containers and their connections.

To ensure that the application is running properly, you could perform some load testing on it:

<!-- deploy-doc-start run-tests -->

    ./msdemo-cli loadtest

<!-- deploy-doc-end -->

<!-- deploy-doc-hidden run-tests

    frontend_task=$(aws ecs list-tasks -\-cluster weave-ecs-demo-cluster -\-service-name weavedemo-edge-router-service  -\-query 'taskArns[0]' -\-output text)
    container_inst=$(aws ecs describe-tasks -\-cluster weave-ecs-demo-cluster -\-tasks $frontend_task -\-query 'tasks[0].containerInstanceArn' -\-output text)
    instance_id=$(aws ecs describe-container-instances -\-cluster weave-ecs-demo-cluster -\-container-instances $container_inst -\-query 'containerInstances[0].ec2InstanceId'  -\-output text)
    dns_name=$(aws ec2 describe-instances -\-instance-ids $instance_id -\-query 'Reservations[0].Instances[*].PublicDnsName' -\-output text)

    cat >> /root/healthcheck.sh <<-EOF
#!/usr/bin/env bash
eval \$(weave env)
docker build -t healthcheck -f Dockerfile-healthcheck .
docker run -\-rm -t healthcheck -s user.weave.local,catalogue.weave.local,cart.weave.local,shipping.weave.local,payment.weave.local,orders.weave.local,queue-master.weave.local -r 5
EOF

    scp -i deploy/aws-ecs/weave-ecs-demo-key.pem -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" /root/healthcheck.sh deploy/healthcheck.rb deploy/Dockerfile-healthcheck ec2-user@$dns_name:/home/ec2-user/
    ssh -i deploy/aws-ecs/weave-ecs-demo-key.pem ec2-user@$dns_name "chmod +x healthcheck.sh; ./healthcheck.sh"

    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        exit 1;
    fi
-->


#### Cleanup

To tear down the containers and their associated AWS objects, run the cleanup script:

<!-- deploy-doc-start destroy-infrastructure -->

    ./msdemo-cli destroy

<!-- deploy-doc-end -->

#### ms-demo Commands

##### build
Builds the deployment using cloud formation

##### destroy 
Destroys the deployment

##### status
Get status of deployment, will throw error if deployment was already destroyed

##### dns
Get DNS endpoint

##### loadtest
Run loadtest
